# Sarathi-Serve

This repository contains the code for [Taming Throughput-Latency Tradeoff in LLM Inference with Sarathi-Serve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02310).
This codebase also serves as the baseline for fidelity tests for the LLM inference system simulator [Vidur](https://github.com/microsoft/vidur).

## Setup

### Setup CUDA

Sarathi-Serve has been tested with CUDA 12.1 on A100 and A40 GPUs.

### Clone repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/sarathi.git
```

### Create mamba environment

Setup mamba if you don't already have it,

```sh
wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh # follow the instructions from there
```

Create a Python 3.10 environment,

```sh
mamba create -p ./env python=3.10  
```

### Install Dev Dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Install PyTorch

```sh
pip install torch==2.2.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

### Update NCCL

NCCL 2.19 which ships with torch 2.2 by default is buggy, update NCCL to the latest (2.21).
This setup may need to be repeated after the `Install Sarathi-Serve` step is done.

```sh
pip install -U nvidia-nccl-cu12
```

### Install FlashAttention

```sh
pip install ninja packaging
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd third_party/flash-attention
python setup.py install
```

### Install Sarathi-Serve

```sh
pip install -e . --extra-index-url https://flashinfer.ai/whl/cu121/torch2.3/
```

## Acknowledgment

This repository originally started as a fork of the [vLLM project](https://vllm-project.github.io/). Sarathi-Serve is a research prototype and does not have complete feature parity with open-source vLLM. We have only retained the most critical features and adopted the codebase for faster research iterations.
